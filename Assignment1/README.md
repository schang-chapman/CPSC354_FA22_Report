# Critical Appraisal

## Part 1
This program was compiled with the help of the conversion table provided in the hints section of the assignment page. While NN and PP were largely constructed with the use of the construction tables, later functions relied more on GitHub CoPilot. I would run the code from CoPilot and debug based on what errors came up. Functions were tested one by one as they were completed. I found working on the QQ functions with the conversion table especially helpful because it visually represented to me how the the various other number types were incorporated into it. There are no known errors.
